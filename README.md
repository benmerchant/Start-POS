# Start-POS
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/benmerchant/Start-POS/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/benmerchant/Start-POS?branch=master)

I read a Medium article that said one of the biggest problems new developers embody is the unwillingness to scrap a project if they realize that their approach is not the right one. My approach on this was not the right one. This will be the final commit for this project.

Moving forward, the main paradigm shift that will take place in v2 will be the complete separation of then Front End and Back End environments. I will leave this code up as a reminder of where I started, but I will either rename it and start pushing code on top of it or just start a completely new repo. I haven't decided yet.
